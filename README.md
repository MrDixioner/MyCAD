# MyCAD

A simple CAD editor project based on a series of videos by Mojtaba Javadi (https://www.youtube.com/@MjSharp).

The code will be gradually updated as the video course progresses.

At the moment, the project code is relevant up to and including video number 55 (this line will be updated).

Some comments:
1. The code is written entirely by hand and repeats everything in the video. However, the program does not work correctly in some cases. For example:
* the linear array has its horizontal and vertical lines mixed up.
* modifications with text work correctly, but the guide is not displayed correctly.
* intersection points between the circle and the ellipse are not displayed (the author never answered the question under the video).
2. All icons in the program are taken from the MoI 3D program and will be replaced with others later. I do not encourage you to repeat the same thing, since it is possible that the author of the program has prohibited this (author, forgive me...).
